-----------------------------------------

- Created A* algorithm coding to optimize pathfinding algorithm
	Previous algorithm giving too much errors (75-80% error rates)
	Reduced down to 1%

- A*
	Similar to Djikstra's method
	Uses a Heuristic approach to find the best route
		Computes f(n) based on distances calculated from current position to target
		Constantly pulls from these calculations and also takes into account of objects in the way
	Is a best-first search with heuristic logistics, making it better than Djikstra
	A bit more memory intensive since it relies on more calculations at each step


TEST_1 - did not time

Test_2  - end points don't exactly line up
Elapsed time is 4519.512677 seconds.

TEST 3
Elapsed time is 6810.194947 seconds.


TO DO STILL:

- Bypass failed path by recreating another valid path

- Optimize the algorithm 
	Create function?
	Use less matrices
