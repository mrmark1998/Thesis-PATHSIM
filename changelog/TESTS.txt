DPD only checks the middle 251 x 251 matrix subset

(401,401) to (652,652)

Keep same coordinates

-------------------------------------

Test 1: 2 Paths A and B, starting coords are same, similar paths

Test 2: 2 Paths A and B, ending coordinates are the same

Test 3: 2 Paths A and B, that meet somewhere in the middle
